This repository is for Project 1 of the Undacity Data Science for Scientists nanodegree.

## Project Aim
The goal of the project is to ask questions with business or real-world applications, and analyse a publically available dataset to find insights to answer these questions. I decided to analyse the results of the 2017 Stack Overflow Annual Developer Survey for insights to help people answer the question "Is a career in technology right for me?" I decided to do this by searching for relationships between personality and career success in order to answer the following three questions:

- How does personality relate to employability?
- How does personality relate to salary?
- How does personality relate to job satisfaction?

As a measurement of personality, I analysed the responses to several "agree/disagree" type questions.

## Analysis
I started by plotting the distribution of responses for 20 "agree/disagree" type questions, as shown in the following bar charts:

For my analysis I wanted to use questions with a fairly even distribution of responses, to give me a better distribution of data to use for finding correlations. As such, I decided to use the following 10 questions:

- I tend to get bored by implementation details
- Diversity in the workplace is important
- There's a right and a wrong way to do everything
- I think of myself as competing with my peers
- I want to change the world
- It's better to ship now and optimize later
- Maintaining other people's code is a form of torture
- Most project management techniques are useless
- I enjoy debugging code
- It's harder to collaborate with remote peers than those on site
